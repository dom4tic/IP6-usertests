# User Testing Instructions for the Dimensional Charting Extension

Thank you for participating in our user tests for the dimensional charting extension for the [Kolibri toolkit](https://github.com/WebEngineering-FHNW/Kolibri). We truly appreciate your time and feedback! Below you will find the tasks we have prepared for you.

### Dimensional Charting
Dimensional Charting is a toolkit that takes complex datasets and turns them into 
interactive charts. It groups and aggregates data based on set dimensions, and 
creates charts like pie, bar, and line charts along with axes, legends, and tables. 
It also supports responsive design and basic user interactions like selection and hover 
effects, making it easy to add dynamic data visuals to web apps.

## Setup
